Wavemoth
========


Please read the paper [1] for more information about this software.
Note that this code is *experimental*, and has not yet had its first
release. If you know what you're looking for, go find it. If you are a
researcher who just want to speed up your SHTs, you are better off
using libpsht until Wavemoth has its first release.

Notes:

 - I have not yet renamed things, so earlier names abound in the source
   ("spherew", "fastsht").
 - Yes, I intend to clean things up a bit. I believe the code is sound enough,
   but there's some unused cruft around that should be removed to make it
   easier for others to enter the source code base.

Please, send me an email if you are interested in the software. If
more than one person comes along I'll set up a mailing list.

Build instructions
------------------

Depends on:
    
    - Python (probably 2.7, perhaps 2.6 may work)
    - The normal scientific Python stack
    - The Tempita package
      (e.g., ``easy_install tempita`` or ``pip install tempita``).
    - The futures package (e.g., ``easy_install futures``)
    - ATLAS
    - FFTW3
    - libnuma

Then first configure:

    ./waf configure --inplace \
        --with-atlas=path/to/atlas
        --with-fftw3=... \
        --with-numa=...

And build:

    ./waf install

Then run precomputations:

    python scripts/precompute.py ... 2048.dat

and benchmarks, e.g.:

    bin/shbench -r 2048.dat -j 1 -n 10

future (which would require getting rid of GPL dependencies, such as
optionally linking to FFTPACK or MKL instead of FFTW3). If you send
patches, you should either attribute the copyright to me, or we should
work out the licensing issue first.
